Linear Score
The LinearScore class computes global and categorical (tag) linear scores based on given features and their respective weights. This class is useful for calculating scores in various applications, particularly in data analysis and machine learning scenarios.

Usage
To use the LinearScore class, follow these steps:

Initialization: Initialize the LinearScore object with the required parameters:
python
Copy code
linear_scorer = LinearScore(df_weights, df_features, primary_key)
df_weights: A DataFrame containing the weights of features.
df_features: A DataFrame containing the features.
primary_key: The primary key of the features DataFrame.
Calculate Scores: Call the calculate_score method to compute global and categorical scores:
python
Copy code
scores = linear_scorer.calculate_score()
This method returns a DataFrame containing the calculated scores.
Example
Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of the LinearScore class:

python
Copy code
# Initialize LinearScore object
linear_scorer = LinearScore(df_weights, df_features, primary_key)

# Calculate scores
scores = linear_scorer.calculate_score()

# Print the resulting scores DataFrame
print(scores)
CatBoost Base Model
The BaseCatBoostModel class serves as a base model for training CatBoostClassifier models. It provides functionalities for training, predicting, and evaluating CatBoost models.

Usage
To use the BaseCatBoostModel class, follow these steps:

Initialization: Initialize the BaseCatBoostModel object with the required parameters:
python
Copy code
catboost_model = BaseCatBoostModel(target, features, cat_features)
target: The target column for prediction.
features: List of feature columns.
cat_features: List of categorical feature columns.
Train the Model: Train the CatBoost model using the train method:
python
Copy code
catboost_model.train(X_train, y_train)
This method trains the model using the provided training data.
Predictions: Generate predictions using the trained model:
python
Copy code
predictions = catboost_model.predict(df)
This method returns a DataFrame containing the predicted probabilities.
Evaluation: Evaluate the model using evaluation metrics:
python
Copy code
metrics = catboost_model.calculate_metrics(X_test, y_true)
This method returns an object containing various evaluation metrics.
Example
Here's a simple example demonstrating the usage of the BaseCatBoostModel class:

python
Copy code
# Initialize BaseCatBoostModel object
catboost_model = BaseCatBoostModel(target, features, cat_features)

# Train the model
catboost_model.train(X_train, y_train)

# Generate predictions
predictions = catboost_model.predict(df)

# Evaluate the model
metrics = catboost_model.calculate_metrics(X_test, y_true)

# Print evaluation metrics
print(metrics)
You can tailor these templates according to your specific requirements and add more details as needed.
